# ExecutionPlanner Implementation Summary

## Overview
The ExecutionPlanner has been successfully integrated into steve-code to provide dynamic, AI-powered file discovery and execution planning without any hardcoded assumptions about programming languages or project structures.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. ExecutionPlanner (`src/ai_code_assistant/execution_planner.py`)
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Uses Bedrock AI to analyze user requests and determine what needs to be discovered
- **Zero Assumptions**: Makes no assumptions about programming language, build tools, or project structure
- **Three-Step Process**:
  1. Get initial plan with discovery commands
  2. Execute discovery commands to understand the project
  3. Create final plan based on actual discoveries

### 2. Integration with InteractiveMode
- **Modified `_process_message`**: Replaced old intent analysis with ExecutionPlanner
- **Removed Hardcoded Patterns**: No more hardcoded file patterns or language assumptions
- **AI-Driven Discovery**: Bedrock determines what files to look for based on user request

## Key Features

### Discovery-First Approach
```python
# Example: User says "summarize the screenshots"
# ExecutionPlanner generates:
{
  "discovery_commands": [
    {"cmd": "find . -type f -name '*.png' -o -name '*.jpg'", "purpose": "Find image files"},
    {"cmd": "ls -la", "purpose": "See project structure"}
  ]
}
```

### Language-Agnostic
- Works with any programming language (Python, Java, JS, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Discovers project type dynamically
- Adapts to any build system or project structure

### Context-Aware Planning
- Understands user intent through AI analysis
- Creates specific plans based on discoveries
- Provides appropriate file patterns and search strategies

## Benefits

1. **No Hardcoding**: Completely removes assumptions about project types
2. **Scalability**: Works with any language or framework
3. **Intelligence**: Uses AI to understand context and create appropriate plans
4. **Flexibility**: Adapts to different project structures automatically
5. **User-Friendly**: Shows clear interpretation of user intent

## Example Usage Flow

1. User: "Help me analyze my Java application"
2. ExecutionPlanner:
   - Runs discovery: `find . -name '*.java'`, `find . -name 'pom.xml'`
   - Detects Maven project with Java files
   - Creates plan to analyze Java source files
3. steve-code: Automatically includes relevant Java files for analysis

## Next Steps

To fully leverage the ExecutionPlanner:

1. **Test with Various Projects**: Try it with different languages and frameworks
2. **Enhance Discovery Commands**: Add more sophisticated discovery patterns
3. **Improve Plan Execution**: Fully implement the plan execution in interactive mode
4. **Add Caching**: Cache discovery results for performance

## Implementation Notes

- The old `_analyze_intent` method is still present but no longer used
- File discovery is now completely dynamic based on AI analysis
- Verbose mode shows the discovery process and plan details
- The system gracefully handles projects of any type without prior knowledge
